# Personal Code of Ethic

## Premises

One only has two options towards oneself. One can be either:

* good towards oneself \(further one’s life\);
* or bad towards oneself \(harm one’s life\).

But one has three options towards anyone else. One can be:

* good towards someone \(further their life\);
* bad towards someone \(harm their life\);
* or neutral towards someone \(neither further nor harm their life\).

Because the resources one owns are always limited, it is impossible for one to be good to everyone in the world without being bad to oneself at the same time. However, it is possible for one to be neutral towards everyone else that is not bad to oneself.

It is rational to be good to those that are good to oneself when both sides gain \(when no one loses\); that is, when the exchange is fair.

## Oath

I shall, in priority order, strive to:

1. use reason to define what is good or bad for myself \(never let whims nor emotions to define what furthers or harms my life\);
2. be good to myself \(further my life\);
3. be good to my children \(conceived or adopted\) until they are able to further their own life;
4. be good to my loved ones whenever I can \(help them further their lives unless it will harm my own\);
5. be good towards others when there is a fair exchange \(both sides equally further each other’s lives\);
6. be neutral towards anyone else if they are not bad to me \(bring no harm to anyone’s life as they do not harm mine\).

I shall observe the next priority only when it does not contradict a prior one. That is, I shall never initiate harm against anyone, but I shall protect myself and my loved ones when harm is initiated against us. And I shall never harm myself.

## Rights

In accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

1. Anyone has the right to follow this personal code of ethics as long as one abides to the rule of law.
2. No one shall ever be forced to follow this personal code of ethics, but everyone is equal before the law.
3. Anyone guided by reason has the right to:
   1. identify what is good to further one’s life, and what is bad \(or harmful\) to one’s life;
   2. choose who to love \(those who they will help without expecting a return\), and decide when to love them \(love is a constant choice\);
   3. choose who to trade with \(those who they will engage with for a fair exchange\), and decide when to do so \(while both sides further each other's lives\).

## Conflict Resolution

When two individuals follow this code of ethics, they accept there should be no conflict of interests between them. If a conflict arises between the two parties, then it is a fact that at least one side is not behaving according to this code of ethics. Both parties then shall argue peacefully \(without harming one another\) in order to determine which party \(if not both\) is breaching this code of ethics.

If no agreement is reached, they shall appoint a third-party \(a mediator\), which follows this code of ethics, to aid them in determining where the breach resides. If no mediator is agreed upon, or no agreement is reached with mediation, then each party shall follow their separate ways and shall not interact again, except with the intent to resolve their conflict.
