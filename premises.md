# Premises

One only has two options towards oneself. One can be either:

* good towards oneself \(further one’s life\);
* or bad towards oneself \(harm one’s life\).

But one has three options towards anyone else. One can be:

* good towards someone \(further their life\);
* bad towards someone \(harm their life\);
* or neutral towards someone \(neither further nor harm their life\).

Because the resources one owns are always limited, it is impossible for one to be good to everyone in the world without being bad to oneself at the same time. However, it is possible for one to be neutral towards everyone else that is not bad to oneself.

It is rational to be good to those that are good to oneself when both sides gain \(when no one loses\); that is, when the exchange is fair.
