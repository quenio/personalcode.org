# Conflict Resolution

When two individuals follow this code of ethics, they accept there should be no conflict of interests between them. If a conflict arises between the two parties, then it is a fact that at least one side is not behaving according to this code of ethics. Both parties then shall argue peacefully \(without harming one another\) in order to determine which party \(if not both\) is breaching this code of ethics.

If no agreement is reached, they shall appoint a third-party \(a mediator\), which follows this code of ethics, to aid them in determining where the breach resides. If no mediator is agreed upon, or no agreement is reached with mediation, then each party shall follow their separate ways and shall not interact again, except with the intent to resolve their conflict.
