# Values

## Reason

Accept reason as one's only:

1. source of knowledge;
2. method of making judgements;
3. guide to action.

## Purpose

Recognize that:

1. being productive is the only way that one can sustain one's life;&#x20;
2. one has to be constantly working to improve one's life.

## Self-Esteem

Understand that:

1. one's life is one's most precious possession;
2. one is capable of improving one's life by using rationality and focus;
3. one is _not_ ominiscient nor infallible, but one can learn from errors, define goals and achieve them.
4. one should be proud of one's achievements.
