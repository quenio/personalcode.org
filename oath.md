# Oath

I shall, in priority order, strive to:

1. use reason to define what is good or bad for myself \(never let whims nor emotions to define what furthers or harms my life\);
2. be good to myself \(further my life\);
3. be good to my children \(conceived or adopted\) until they are able to further their own life;
4. be good to my loved ones whenever I can \(help them further their lives unless it will harm my own\);
5. be good towards others when there is a fair exchange \(both sides equally further each other’s lives\);
6. be neutral towards anyone else if they are not bad to me \(bring no harm to anyone’s life as they do not harm mine\).

I shall observe the next priority only when it does not contradict a prior one. That is, I shall never initiate harm against anyone, but I shall protect myself and my loved ones when harm is initiated against us. And I shall never harm myself.
